# Neural-Signals-and-Machine-Learning-Tools-for-Neural-Data
This repository includes the code I wrote for the weekly assignments in this Biomedical Engineering course. 

- Week 1: Creating raster plots, peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTH), and receptive field analysis.
- Week 2: Calculating the entropy of a spike train, the mutual information between two neurons, and the joint mutual information for multiple stimuli.
- Week 3: Developing a PSTH classifier.
- Week 4: Principal component analysis (PCA) + PSTH classifier. 
  - For more details please see the paper by Foffani and Moxon (2004).
